pseudocode
START
  INPUT A, B, C
  IF A > B AND A > C THEN
      MAXIMUM = A
  ELSE IF B > C THEN
      MAXIMUM = B
  ELSE
      MAXIMUM = C
  ENDIF
  OUTPUT MAXIMUM
END

2. Compare and Contrast Two Programming Languages
Python vs. Java:
Python:

Strengths: Simple syntax, dynamically typed, vast libraries, excellent for data science and machine learning.
Weaknesses: Slower execution speed, less suitable for mobile development.
Java:

Strengths: Platform independence (via JVM), strong performance, robust community support.
Weaknesses: Verbose syntax, slower development time for small projects.

3.
Compilation:
Converts the entire source code into machine code before execution. Examples: C, Java (bytecode). Faster at runtime but requires recompilation after changes.

Interpretation:
Executes code line-by-line without prior conversion to machine code. Examples: Python, JavaScript. Slower but more flexible for scripting and testing.

4.Flowchart steps:

Start
Input a number N
Initialize factorial = 1
Loop from 1 to N (multiply factorial by the loop variable)
Output factorial
End

5.
def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
    """Calculate the area of a rectangle."""
    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
        return "Length and width must be positive values."
    return length * width

# Example 
length = 5
width = 3
print("Area:", calculate_rectangle_area(length, width))
